## The Bachelor and The Bachelorette: Polarity of Contestants

## Purpose: 
To look at, through Twitter data, how people feel about the shows The Bachelor and The Bachelorette in 2018 and 2019. From this project, others can understand the varying sentiments on the program across the country. Additionally, some questions addressed include: Is public sentiment generally positive or negative? Is it the same across all seasons/all parts of the country?

## End Product: 
We created several visualization tools using Tableau published on an online interface. On this interface, users can interact with the data clicking on content they would like to visualize. Some examples of the visualizations include: </br>
* Word Frequency in tweets (word cloud) </br>
* Tweet Count over time </br>
* Tweet volume by state </br>
* Average tweet sentiment by state </br>
The interactive component allows users to compare visualizations by season and by episode. </br>
</br>
Additionally, this project was presented to an audience at The Claremont Colleges detailing the project process from idea formulation to data scraping to analysis (all of which are linked below).
